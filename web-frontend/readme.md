# Web frontend development

First we need to create an React app. The first react app will be about jsx and we can just name the project as jsx.

```bash
npx create-react-app jsx
```

It can take several minutes to finish creating the project. Once the app is created, you can go into the jsx folder and start the app by the following command. You should see the React logo on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

```bash
cd jsx && npm start
```
